This is the repo for course content for TCD's witidtm elective module.
(TEU00311) The canonical URL for this is
[https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/witidtm/](https://down.dsg.cs.tcd.ie/witidtm/).

We'll be using the TCD
[Blackboard](https://tcd.blackboard.com/webapps/blackboard/execute/content/blankPage?cmd=view&content_id=_1600800_1&course_id=_69120_1)
tool for assignments etc. Apologies that only registered students can see that
material.

## <div id="lect-header">Lecture/Online Session Schedule</div>

<div id="lect" markdown="1"> 

It's all online for now this year, sadly.

</div>
<div id="lect-times" markdown="1"> 
  
- Tuesday 1000-1050 online
- Thursday 1600-1750 online
  
</div>
<div id="office" markdown="1">   

We'll do an "office hours" session Monday's at 1100, just drop in to the
"Monday" blackboard session, and chat as you want. We can swap the timeslot
later in the semester depending on how it conflicts with people's
schedules.

Lecture content will accumulate [here](./lectures/2020-2021/) as we go.
Be aware that the content will change, even sometimes at the last minute!

You can look at the materials from [2019 here](./lectures/2019-2020/). 
Some of that is re-used as-is, some modified, some things will be new.
